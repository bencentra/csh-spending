CSH Spending Website
====================

Written by Ben Centra.

New internal website for making CSH's expenditures open to it's members for better budget management and financial consciousness.

No one will use this besides me, probably.

Not included is mysql_vars.php, since it contains sensitive information.

To-Do's
-------
- Refactor code for displaying each table. Make it a PHP function! 
- Change budgets from a series of constants to an associative array (key is committee, value is percent or $$$ total)
